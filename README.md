## Cam

We developed the game Cam, with the following game modes: *PC vs PC*, *Player vs PC* and *Player vs Player*. There are two levels of difficulty, one where the plays are selected randomly, and another one where every board is evaluated with a number from 0 to 100 and best one is chosen. This evaluation takes into account the distance between the opponent's castle and the player's piece which is closest to it, the average of the difference between every piece of the player and the opponent's castle, and whether or not the board holds a piece of the player which has an enemy next to it.

The implementation as well as the game are further explained in [here](https://github.com/helenaMontenegro/PLOG-18-19/blob/master/Cam/report.pdf).
